# Project Title:
Room Traffic Prediction

# Description:
Hotel room prices in different places increase every year, so there is a
need for a system to predict the prices in the future. This prediction can
help the owner determine the booking price of a hotel room and help the customer book a room.
To predict rent (per day) I used regression models.

# Dataset:
A unique dataset is created which has 300 data and predicts Rent(Per Day) in BDT. These data are collected from different websites which are available publicly.

# Model:
Decision Tree Regression, Ridge Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Lasso Regression, and Support vector Regression models are used.

# Language:
Python
